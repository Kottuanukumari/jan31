                <p>There is uniqueness in the way a traditional Kerala house is built and the story behind it is very interesting too. A simple traditional Kerala house is known as the Nalukettu and these houses were constructed by the logical principles of the customary Thachu Shastra (the study of architecture).The traditional architectural style of the houses in Kerala is called nalukettu. Nalu means four and kettu means blocks. A nalukettu refers to a rectangular structure where four blocks are linked by an open courtyard. Nalukettu is largely single-storeyed and made with wood</p>

            <p>Homestay is a relatively new concept that has been introduced to the tourism sphere. In fact, the very notion of ‘home’ seems somewhat contradictory when we talk about tourism, doesn’t it? I mean, we travel to get away from home… Well, it turns out that homestay tourism has grown considerably is recent years.

                <p> that increased tourism activity leads to increased housing prices in certain Italian cities, but in other cities, increased tourism activity decreases housing prices. The negative effect of tourism on housing prices is found primarily in small cities where marine tourism predominates.Allowing the transfer of existing real estate from the housing market to the tourism market illustrates the Law of Unanticipated Consequences ( Merton, 1936 ), where immediate interests override long-term interests (higher rental yields in the tourism market than in the housing market overriding affordable housing).</p>
                <p>In the same context, with the use of a case study, we also review an alternative way to quantify the effects of tourism, through the creation of a composite tourism index that enters directly into the house price estimation function.The indexes are based on six main indicators: local expenditures in recreation and tourism sector, number of summer houses, total number of recreational structures (hotels, camp sites, and tourist villages), number of employees in the tourism industry (used to calculate location quotients), distance from the coast, and the altitude.</p>
